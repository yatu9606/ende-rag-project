Endee is a lightweight vector database designed for AI and machine learning applications.
It enables efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vector embeddings.

Semantic search retrieves documents based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.
It uses vector embeddings to understand the semantic context of user queries.

Retrieval Augmented Generation, also known as RAG, combines information retrieval with text generation.
RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents and then generate accurate answers using a language model.

Vector databases are essential for modern AI systems such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and search platforms.
They allow fast similarity search over large collections of embeddings.

Sentence Transformers are models that convert text into dense numerical vector representations.
These embeddings capture semantic meaning and are used for tasks like semantic search and clustering.

Embeddings represent text, images, or other data in numerical form.
They make it possible to compare similarity between different pieces of content.

Artificial Intelligence systems often rely on embeddings to understand user intent.
Machine learning models use embeddings as input features for downstream tasks.

Endee can be used as the vector storage layer in AI pipelines.
It plays a critical role in enabling fast and accurate similarity search.

Semantic similarity measures how close two texts are in meaning.
Cosine similarity is commonly used to compute similarity between embeddings.

RAG-based systems improve answer quality by grounding responses in retrieved knowledge.
This reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.
